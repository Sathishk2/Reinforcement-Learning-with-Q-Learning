# Reinforcement-Learning-with-Q-Learning

Hi

Thanks for visiting my Reinforcement learning with Q Learning respository.

In this repository, I learn how to use the Q-Learning algorithm to train an agent to navigate a popular enviornment from the Open AI Gym. 

Through this tutorial, I use the FrozenLake-v1 enviornment in Open AI Gym. 
The goal of the agent is to navigate a frozen lake and find the Goal without falling through the ice (render the enviornment above to see an example).

There are:

16 states (one for each square)
4 possible actions (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP)
4 different types of blocks (F: frozen, H: hole, S: start, G: goal)

Lastly, I also graph the average reward based on the number of episodes after finding the goal.
